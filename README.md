# 📝 Note
- Thanks to Salvinator: Under Covid 19 quarantine I found [this](https://salvinator.github.io/) project, 
that had inspired me to start this repository.
- Why _pistoBot_?

# ⚠ Disclaimer
This project is only a **personal playground** build during the week-ends of Covid-19 quarantine.<br>
Used mainly to:
- Write code on tensorflow 2.0
- Use famous packages (like [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple))
- Gain (little) experience

Due to this nature, this repository has probably: 
- ML _naif approaches_ 
- For sure: not so good english text (sorry 😢)
- Maybe something similar already exist
