# ü§ñ pistoBot (work in progress)

Use different AI system trained on user messages (whatsapp and telegram) to generate user-like chats.

# In a nutshell
- Get your whatsapp and telegram data
- Parse it using [this](https://github.com/GuardatiSimone/messaging-chat-parser)
- Train one of the [available](https://github.com/GuardatiSimone/pistoBot/tree/master/pistoBot) models
- Chat with the model

- :point_right: A colab notebook that perform all steps will be provided soon 

**Example of chat**

An example of GPT-2 model trained on my whatsapp and telegram messages.

Tags meaning: 
- `[:pencil2:]` indicate a message that I have wrote
- `[:robot:]` indicate a message generated from the model

Chat:
```
[:pencil2:] come sei messo col pistobot?
[:robot:] ahaha male
[:pencil2:] chatta meglio di te? üòÇ
[ :robot: ] si
[:pencil2:] non che ci volesse molto...
[:robot:] ma tu che dici
[:pencil2:] io dico che potevi impegnarti di pi√π
```

**Requirements**<br>
- At top layer the "common" requirements and each model have custom `requirements.txt`.
- This code has only been tested with Python >= 3.6.

# üìù Note
- Thanks to Salvinator: Under Covid 19 quarantine I found [this](https://salvinator.github.io/) project, 
that had inspired me to start this repository.
- Why _pistoBot_?

# ‚ö† Disclaimer
This project is only a **personal playground** build during the week-ends of Covid-19 quarantine.<br>
Used mainly to:
- Write code on tensorflow 2.0
- Use famous packages (like [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/))
- Gain (little) experience

Due to this nature, this repository has probably: 
- ML _naif approaches_ 
- For sure: not so good english text (sorry üò¢)
